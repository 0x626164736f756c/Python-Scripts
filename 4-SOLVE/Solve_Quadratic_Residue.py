#  resolve a modular expression with the modulo and the prime we can give this 
#  simple calculation of power is like pow(number,exponent) : pow(11,2) = 121 
#  --------> precedent reminder  :  
#                 modular arithmetic is like we want find x like a = x % modulo
#                 a â‰¡ b mod m <=> a % m = b
#                 so for 11 = x mod 6 we can do 11%6 = 5 so we know 11 = 5 mod 6   
#  --------> precedent reminder  :
#  we start now by a number with exponent = so we have a = 11exponent2 = 11x11 = pow(11,2) = 121
#  with a modulo know we can make  11exponent2 = x mod 29 = pow(11,2) = x mod 29  
#  we want to find the x so we can do pow(11,2,29) = 5 
#  the SQUARE ROOT OF 5 is 11 but not all number have a square root like this
#  lets try with that :
#

        # and we knwo we need to find the exponent(wich is 2) so
        # we use pow() with exponent knowing and modulo knowing
        calcul_residue = pow(x,2,well_know_modulo)
